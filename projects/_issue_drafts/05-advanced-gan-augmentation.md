# [Project] Advanced: GAN-based defect augmentation

## Summary

Implement a simple GAN to augment defect images and improve baseline performance.

## Project Context

- Project type: computer-vision, generative
- Location: `projects/advanced/gan_defect_augmentation/`
- Related module(s): module-8 (GANs), module-6

## Deliverables

- [ ] Optional dependency checks (torch)
- [ ] CLI to generate augmented dataset
- [ ] Before/after evaluation on CV starter project

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Augmentation pipeline runs on sample data
- [ ] Evaluation shows measurable impact (documented)
