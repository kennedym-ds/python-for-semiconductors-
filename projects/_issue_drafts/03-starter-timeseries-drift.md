# [Project] Starter time-series: equipment drift monitor

## Summary

Time-series baseline for drift detection and forecasting.

## Project Context

- Project type: time-series
- Location: `projects/starter/equipment_drift_monitor/`
- Related module(s): module-5 (time series), module-10.1

## Problem / Why

Enable predictive maintenance baseline aligned with CLI standards.

## Scope

- In scope: feature extraction, sliding windows, anomaly metrics
- Out of scope: deep learning models

## Deliverables

- [ ] Project skeleton with README
- [ ] Train/evaluate/predict CLI
- [ ] Metrics: MAE, MAPE, anomaly rate
- [ ] Tests and synthetic data generator

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] End-to-end CLI works locally
- [ ] Tests pass locally/CI
- [ ] Uses standardized DATA_DIR resolution
