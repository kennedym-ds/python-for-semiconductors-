# [Project] Starter regression: yield prediction

## Summary

Baseline regression for yield prediction with semiconductor-specific metrics.

## Project Context

- Project type: regression
- Location: `projects/starter/yield_regression/`
- Related module(s): module-3 (regression), module-10.1

## Problem / Why

Provide a reproducible regression baseline aligned with path and CLI standards.

## Scope

- In scope: training, evaluation, prediction, metrics, tests, persistence
- Out of scope: complex model ensembles

## Deliverables

- [ ] Project skeleton with README
- [ ] Pipeline CLI (train/evaluate/predict) with JSON outputs
- [ ] Metrics: MAE, RMSE, RÂ², PWS, Estimated Loss
- [ ] Tests for CLI and pipeline methods

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CLI runs end-to-end on sample/synthetic data
- [ ] Tests pass locally and in CI
- [ ] Follows dataset path conventions and seeding
