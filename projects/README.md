# Projects Overview

The `projects/` directory hosts ready-to-run semiconductor ML projects. Start with `starter/` for baseline implementations, then explore `advanced/` for specialized and MLOps-focused work.

## Structure

- `starter/` — Reference projects (classification, regression, time-series, CV)
- `advanced/` — Advanced projects (GAN augmentation, anomaly detection, MLflow)
- `PROJECTS_BACKLOG.md` — Backlog of planned and in-progress tasks

## Get Started

1) Read `projects/starter/template/README.md` for the template and commands.
2) Use the project architecture pipeline (Module 10.1) to scaffold a new project.
3) Track tasks via `projects/PROJECTS_BACKLOG.md` or create issues using the Project Task template.

## Create Issues

Use the repository’s Project Task issue template to file new work items. Suggested tasks are in `PROJECTS_BACKLOG.md`.
