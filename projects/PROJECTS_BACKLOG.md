# Projects Backlog

This backlog organizes work to build out the `projects/` area with production-grade, semiconductor-focused projects. Each task is written as a GitHub issue-ready item with clear outcomes and acceptance criteria.

## Phases Overview
- Foundation templates and scaffolding
- Starter reference projects (classification, regression, time-series, vision)
- Advanced projects (GAN augmentation, anomaly detection, MLOps/MLflow)
- Documentation, testing, and CI integration

## 1) Scaffolding & Templates

1. Initialize project scaffolding pipeline docs
- Summary: Document usage of `10.1-project-architecture-pipeline.py` for scaffolding and validation.
- Acceptance:
  - README updates in `projects/starter/template/`
  - Example commands verified locally

2. Add cookiecutter-compatible template export
- Summary: Enable exporting the template as a Cookiecutter-ready skeleton to speed up new projects.
- Acceptance:
  - `template/` export command documented
  - Example repo created from export

3. Add `.env.template` and secrets guidance
- Summary: Provide environment variables and secrets handling instructions for all generated projects.
- Acceptance:
  - `.env.template` added to scaffold output
  - README section on secrets management

## 2) Starter Projects

- Acceptance:
  - Data loader and augmentation
  - Metrics: mIoU, pixel accuracy
  - Inference script and visualization

## 3) Advanced Projects

8. GAN-based data augmentation for defects
- Path: `projects/advanced/gan_defect_augmentation/`
- Summary: Implement training/inference for simple GAN to augment defect images.
- Acceptance:
  - Optional dependency checks (torch)
  - CLI to generate augmented dataset
  - Before/after evaluation on CV starter project

9. Unsupervised anomaly detection for equipment

- Summary: Wrap training/evaluation to log params, metrics, and artifacts into MLflow.
- Acceptance:
  - `mlflow` optional dependency
  - Start/stop tracking scripts (local server ok)
  - Example run with artifacts logged

## 4) Documentation & CI

11. Project READMEs and quick-starts
- Summary: Add high-quality READMEs and quick commands for each starter/advanced project.
- Acceptance:
  - Clear run instructions per OS
  - Troubleshooting and dataset notes

12. Tests for generated projects
- Summary: Template-level tests to validate scaffold outputs and minimal run.
- Acceptance:
  - Pytest covering CLI invocation and paths

  - Uses `requirements-basic.txt`

14. Docs site integration for projects
- Summary: Expose project guides via `docs-site` and ensure navigation.
- Acceptance:
  - MkDocs pages linking to each project
  - Build verification

## 5) Stretch Goals

15. Dataset download helpers per project
- Summary: Project-level script to fetch sample/synthetic data.
