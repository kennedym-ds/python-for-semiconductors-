## Manufacturing Context

Every component integrates semiconductor manufacturing domain knowledge:

### Cost Asymmetry
- False Positive cost: $100 (unnecessary rework/scrap)
- False Negative cost: $1000 (defect escapes to customer)
- Threshold optimization reflects real business constraints

### Realistic Data Patterns
- 5-20% defect rate (typical in semiconductor manufacturing)
- Class imbalance (defects are rare)
- Spatial defect patterns (center, edge, scratch, random)

### Production Metrics
- PWS (Prediction Within Spec): Manufacturing quality metric
- Estimated Loss: Cost impact of prediction errors
- Defect Detection Rate: Percentage of defective wafers caught

### Real-World Constraints
- Batch processing (1000 wafers typical)
- Model retraining cycles
- Production deployment requirements
- MES/ERP integration (CLI, JSON)

## Lessons Learned

### Technical
1. **PYTHONPATH Configuration**: Critical for notebook imports in subprocess execution
2. **Dataclass vs Dictionary**: Remember direct attribute access for dataclasses
3. **Test Organization**: Group tests by category (basic, edge, manufacturing, integration, performance)
4. **Performance Targets**: Quantify expectations (< 10s training, < 1s prediction)

### Educational Design
1. **Progressive Difficulty**: Start simple (data generation) → advanced (cost optimization)
2. **Manufacturing Context**: Every exercise should connect to real-world scenarios
3. **Self-Checks**: Include validation questions to confirm understanding
4. **Complete Solutions**: Show best practices, not just working code

### Grading Systems
1. **Automated Execution**: Use nbconvert + nbclient for reliable notebook execution
2. **Detailed Feedback**: Don't just score - explain what's missing
3. **JSON Output**: Enable LMS integration from day one
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Grade what's complete even if notebook crashes
