#### Common Student Mistakes
1. Missing engineered features in predictions
2. Metric interpretation confusion (R¬≤ vs RMSE)
3. Ignoring residual plots
4. Incorrect PWS calculation
5. scikit-learn compatibility issues

#### Prerequisites
- **Required Knowledge**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, statistics, regression
- **Recommended Background**: Modules 1-3.1
- **Semiconductor Domain**: Fabrication basics, process control, yield metrics

### 2. For Instructors Section

#### Teaching Tips
1. Start with synthetic data for intuition
2. Emphasize manufacturing context
3. Show residual plots early
4. Compare multiple models (regularization effects)
5. Connect to real CVD/etch processes

#### Grading Workflow
- **Automated Grading**: Single and batch processing commands
- **Class Summary**: Python script to generate statistics
  - Average score
  - Passing rate
  - Letter grade distribution

#### Exercise Breakdown Table
| Exercise | Points | Auto-Gradable | Manual Review | Time Est. |
|----------|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1: Data Exploration | 20 | ‚úÖ Yes | Visualization quality | 20 min |
| 2: Model Training | 30 | ‚úÖ Yes | Model selection rationale | 30 min |
| 3: Manufacturing Metrics | 25 | ‚úÖ Yes | Interpretation depth | 30 min |
| 4: Deployment | 15 | ‚úÖ Yes | Production considerations | 20 min |
| Code Quality | 10 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Comments, organization | (continuous) |
| **TOTAL** | **100** | **~80%** | **~20%** | **100 min** |

#### Time Estimates
- Exercise 1: 20 min
- Exercise 2: 30 min
- Exercise 3: 30 min
- Exercise 4: 20 min
- **Total**: 100 minutes

#### Assessment Rubric
- **90-100 (Exceptional)**: All complete, insightful analysis, best practices
- **75-89 (Proficient)**: All complete, correct, functional
- **60-74 (Developing)**: Most complete, some errors, needs improvement
- **<60 (Needs Improvement)**: Incomplete, major errors, requires instruction

#### Extensions and Projects
8 suggested follow-up projects:
1. Real Data Integration (SECOM dataset)
2. Hyperparameter Optimization (GridSearchCV)
3. Feature Engineering (domain-specific)
4. Ensemble Methods
5. Deployment Integration (FastAPI)
6. Drift Monitoring
7. Uncertainty Quantification
8. Process Optimization

#### Common Discussion Points
- Q&A format covering:
  - Why Random Forest outperforms Linear models
  - When to use Ridge vs Lasso
  - PWS meaning in manufacturing
  - Why Estimated Loss matters
  - sklearn deprecation handling

### 3. Additional Sections

#### Related Projects
- wafer_defect_classifier
- equipment_drift_monitor
- die_defect_segmentation

#### Reference Documentation
- GRADING_SCRIPT_GUIDE.md
- TEST_SUITE_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md
- SOLUTION_NOTEBOOK_CONTENT.md

## Key Adaptations from Classification Template

### Content Changes
1. **Metrics**: ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall ‚Üí R¬≤, RMSE, MAE
2. **Exercise Focus**: Confusion matrices ‚Üí Residual analysis
3. **Manufacturing Context**: Defect detection ‚Üí Yield optimization
4. **Common Mistakes**: Threshold optimization ‚Üí Engineered features, PWS calculation
5. **Discussion Topics**: Cost asymmetry ‚Üí Regularization effects, non-linear patterns

### Preserved Patterns
1. ‚úÖ Two-section structure (Students / Instructors)
2. ‚úÖ Emoji-based visual hierarchy (üìò üìó üîç)
3. ‚úÖ Exercise difficulty ratings (‚òÖ ‚òÖ‚òÖ ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ)
4. ‚úÖ Code block formatting for all commands
5. ‚úÖ Table-based exercise breakdown
6. ‚úÖ Grading rubric with score ranges
7. ‚úÖ Extensions and follow-up projects

## Section Location

**Inserted After**: "Model Comparison" section (line ~233)

## Validation

### Linting Status
‚ö†Ô∏è Minor markdown linting warnings:
- MD036: Emphasis used instead of heading (acceptable for section labels)
- MD032: Lists should be surrounded by blank lines (style preference)
- MD031: Fenced code blocks spacing (cosmetic)

**All warnings are cosmetic and do not affect functionality.**
