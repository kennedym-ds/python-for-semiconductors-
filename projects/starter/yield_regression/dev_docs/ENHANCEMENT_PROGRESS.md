# Yield Regression Enhancement - Progress Report

**Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Project**: `projects/starter/yield_regression/`  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS (Exercise 1 solution notebook)

## Summary

This document tracks progress on enhancing the yield_regression project to match the completeness of wafer_defect_classifier.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Analysis & Planning

- ✅ Reviewed existing pipeline (422 lines, COMPLETE)
- ✅ Reviewed existing tests (12 tests, BASIC coverage)
- ✅ Reviewed existing README (COMPREHENSIVE documentation)
- ✅ Identified tutorial structure (4 sections: data generation, model training, prediction analysis, deployment)
- ✅ Analyzed missing components:
  - Solution notebook with complete implementations
  - Grading script (evaluate_submission.py)
  - Enhanced test coverage (need 25+ more tests for 37 total)
  - Educational materials section in README

### 2. Solution Notebook - Setup

- ✅ Created `yield_regression_solution.ipynb` with:
  - Introduction and learning objectives
  - Business context and exercise overview
  - Complete setup and imports section
  - Configured for reproducibility (RANDOM_SEED)

## In Progress 🔄

### Exercise 1: Data Generation & Exploration

**Content Created** (ready to add to notebook):

#### Step 1.1: Generate Synthetic Data

```python
df = generate_yield_process(n=800, seed=RANDOM_SEED)
# Display shape, columns, first rows
```

#### Step 1.2: Explore Distributions

```python
# Summary statistics
# Missing value check
# Yield statistics (mean, std, min, max)
```

#### Step 1.3: Visualize Yield Distribution

```python
# Histogram with mean line
# Box plot
# Interpretation: normally distributed around 70%
```

#### Step 1.4: Correlation Analysis

```python
# Correlation matrix with yield
# Heatmap visualization
# Key findings: pressure_sq (-0.85), time (0.45)
```

#### Step 1.5: Scatter Plots

```python
# 4 scatter plots (temperature, pressure, flow, time vs yield)
# Polynomial trend lines
# Correlation annotations
```

#### Key Takeaways Section

- Data characteristics (800 samples, 8 features, yield 60-77%)
- Important correlations (pressure_sq strongest at r=-0.85)
- Manufacturing insights (pressure optimal window, time positive effect)
- Next steps (ready for modeling, expect non-linear models to excel)

**Issue Encountered**: Terminal/file system issues preventing direct addition of cells to notebook JSON.

**Workaround Options**:

1. Manually open notebook in Jupyter and add cells interactively
2. Use VS Code notebook editor to add cells
3. Fix terminal issues and retry Python script approach

## Pending Tasks 📋

### High Priority

#### Exercise 2: Model Training & Comparison

- Train 5 models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Random Forest
- Compare metrics: MAE, RMSE, R², PWS, Estimated Loss
- Visualize comparison (bar charts for each metric)
- Select best model based on R²
- Key takeaways on model performance

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Complexity**: Moderate (adapt from wafer_defect_classifier Exercise 2)

#### Exercise 3: Manufacturing Metrics & Residual Analysis

- Calculate PWS and Estimated Loss
- Residual analysis (residual plot, distribution)
- Actual vs Predicted scatter plot
- Feature importance (for RF model)
- Manufacturing interpretation
- Key takeaways on manufacturing metrics

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Complexity**: Advanced (regression-specific metrics, different from classification)

#### Exercise 4: Model Deployment & CLI

- Save model with metadata
- Load model and verify
- CLI command demonstrations (train, evaluate, predict)
- Production deployment checklist
- Key takeaways on deployment patterns

**Estimated Time**: 20 minutes
**Complexity**: Moderate (similar to wafer_defect Exercise 4)

### Medium Priority

#### Grading Script (`evaluate_submission.py`)

**Based on**: `wafer_defect_classifier/evaluate_submission.py`

**Key Adaptations**:

- Change notebook path: `yield_regression_tutorial.ipynb`
- Update exercise patterns: 4 exercises (same as wafer_defect)
- Adapt metric validation for regression:
  - Replace ROC-AUC → R²
  - Replace precision/recall → RMSE/MAE
  - Keep PWS and Estimated Loss (same concept)
- Update rubric (100 points total):
  - Exercise 1: 20 points
  - Exercise 2: 30 points
  - Exercise 3: 25 points
  - Exercise 4: 15 points
  - Code Quality: 10 points

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Complexity**: Moderate (template exists, need regression adaptations)

#### Test Expansion

**Current**: 12 tests (basic functionality)  
**Target**: 37 tests (matching wafer_defect pattern)  
**Need**: 25 additional tests

**Categories to Add**:

1. **Edge Cases** (8 tests):
   - Zero yield predictions
   - 100% yield predictions
   - Negative predictions (should be clipped)
   - Missing features in input
   - Extreme parameter values
   - Empty dataset handling
   - Single sample training
   - NaN/Inf in predictions

2. **Manufacturing Scenarios** (6 tests):
   - High R² requirement (>0.8)
   - Spec limit violations (PWS < threshold)
   - Outlier handling
   - Process drift simulation
   - Multi-modal yield distributions
   - Cost sensitivity analysis

3. **Integration Tests** (6 tests):
   - End-to-end pipeline workflow
   - Model versioning and rollback
   - Batch prediction performance
   - Cross-validation stability
   - Feature importance consistency
   - Hyperparameter robustness

4. **Performance Benchmarks** (5 tests):
   - Training time (< 10 seconds for 1000 samples)
   - Prediction latency (< 0.01s per sample)
   - Memory usage (< 100 MB)
   - Model file size (< 10 MB)
   - Reproducibility (same seed → same results)

**Estimated Time**: 3 hours
**Complexity**: Moderate (template pattern exists)

### Low Priority

#### README Educational Section

**Add section**: "Educational Materials"

**Subsections**:

1. **For Learners**:
   - Interactive tutorial description
   - Solution notebook description
   - Grading script usage
   - Expected completion time (100 minutes)

2. **For Instructors**:
   - Common student mistakes (specific to regression)
   - Teaching tips (regression vs classification nuances)
   - Grading workflow commands
   - Extensions and follow-up projects

**Template**: Copy from `wafer_defect_classifier/README.md` Educational Materials section

**Key Adaptations**:

- Replace classification terminology with regression
- Update metrics (R² instead of ROC-AUC)
- Adjust manufacturing context (yield optimization vs defect detection)
- Update exercise descriptions

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Complexity**: Low (template-based)

#### Cleanup & Documentation

- Create `dev_docs/` subdirectory
- Create `PROJECT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`
- Move development notes to dev_docs
- Final README polish

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Complexity**: Low (organizational)

## Timeline Estimate

**Total Remaining Work**: ~8-9 hours

| Task | Time | Priority |
|------|------|----------|
| Solution Notebook - Exercise 1 | 0.5h | ✅ IN PROGRESS |
| Solution Notebook - Exercise 2 | 0.5h | HIGH |
| Solution Notebook - Exercise 3 | 0.5h | HIGH |
| Solution Notebook - Exercise 4 | 0.3h | HIGH |
| Grading Script | 2.0h | HIGH |
| Test Expansion | 3.0h | MEDIUM |
| README Educational Section | 1.0h | MEDIUM |
| Cleanup & Documentation | 0.5h | LOW |

## Technical Notes

### Regression vs Classification Differences

**Metrics**:

- MAE, RMSE, R² vs Precision, Recall, F1
- Still use PWS and Estimated Loss (manufacturing metrics)

**Visualizations**:

- Residual plots vs ROC curves
- Actual vs Predicted scatter vs Confusion matrix
- Residual distribution vs Class distribution

**Manufacturing Context**:

- Yield optimization (continuous) vs Defect detection (binary)
- Process parameter tuning vs Inspection threshold setting
- R² > 0.8 target vs ROC-AUC > 0.9 target

### Dependencies

All dependencies already installed (basic tier):

- numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib

No additional packages needed.
