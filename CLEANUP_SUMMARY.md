# Repository Cleanup Summary - v1.0 Release

**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Purpose**: Remove supplementary development/maintenance documentation not needed by learners

---

## Files Removed

### From `assessments/` Directory

Removed **9 internal progress tracking and phase completion files**:

1. `WEEK_3_CONTENT_PROGRESS.md` - Week 3 internal progress tracking
2. `WEEK_4_TESTING_PROGRESS.md` - Week 4 testing phase progress  
3. `WEEK_4_UPDATE.md` - Week 4 status update
4. `WEEK_4_COMPLETE.md` - Week 4 completion summary
5. `WEEK_4_PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md` - Phase 2 (Assessment System) completion
6. `WEEK_4_PHASE_3_COMPLETE.md` - Phase 3 (Notebook Execution) completion
7. `WEEK_4_PHASE_4_COMPLETE.md` - Phase 4 (Documentation) completion
8. `WEEK_4_PHASE_5_COMPLETE.md` - Phase 5 (CI/CD) completion
9. `v1.0_RELEASE_COMPLETE.md` - v1.0 release internal summary

**Rationale**: These were internal project management documents tracking development phases. Learners only need the final release documentation.

### From `docs/` Directory

Removed **2 maintainer-only files**:

1. `QUICK_REFERENCE_4WEEK_PLAN.md` - Internal 4-week development plan
2. `projects-board-setup.md` - GitHub Projects board setup guide (maintainer-only)

**Rationale**: These were development planning and repository maintenance guides not relevant to learners.
