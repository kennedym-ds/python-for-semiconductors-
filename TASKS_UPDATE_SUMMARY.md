## File Summary

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `.vscode/tasks.json` | 532 | Task definitions (20+ tasks) |

**Total**: ~1000 lines of task automation and documentation added

## Testing

- ‚úÖ JSON structure validated (65 opening braces = 65 closing braces)
- ‚úÖ Comments use `.jsonc` format (VS Code supports this)
- ‚úÖ All task labels follow consistent naming: `Category: Action Description`
- ‚úÖ All tasks have proper `problemMatcher`, `group`, and `type` fields
- ‚úÖ Input definitions properly structured for interactive pickers

## Next Steps

1. **Test tasks in VS Code**: Open Command Palette and verify tasks appear
2. **User feedback**: Gather feedback on task usefulness and naming
3. **Add more pipeline tasks**: Template is ready for adding module-specific pipelines
4. **Platform testing**: Verify Windows/Mac/Linux commands work correctly
5. **Video tutorial**: Consider creating screencast showing task usage
