# ADR-001: Educational Framework Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Python for Semiconductors learning series requires a comprehensive educational framework that supports multiple learning modalities, assessment systems, and progress tracking. The framework must be:

- Modular and extensible
- Compatible with existing pipeline architecture
- Support for interactive learning elements
- Integration with industry-standard tools
- Scalable from individual learners to classroom environments

## Decision
We will implement a multi-tier educational framework with the following components:

### 1. Assessment System
- **ModuleAssessment**: Class-based assessment framework
- **ProgressTracker**: Cross-module progress tracking
- **JSON-based results**: LMS compatibility
- **Multiple assessment types**: Knowledge checks, practical coding, project evaluations

### 2. Interactive Learning Components
- **ipywidgets integration**: Parameter tuning widgets
- **Plotly visualizations**: 3D wafer defect analysis
- **Real-time feedback**: Immediate assessment results
- **Gamification elements**: Badges, achievements, progress tracking

### 3. Gamification System
- **Achievement engine**: Comprehensive badge system
- **Progress analytics**: Learning velocity and pattern analysis
- **Leaderboards**: Social learning motivation
- **Personalized recommendations**: AI-driven learning suggestions

### 4. Documentation Infrastructure
- **Automated API docs**: Code introspection and generation
- **Multi-format output**: HTML, Markdown, JSON
- **Architecture Decision Records**: Decision documentation
- **Interactive examples**: Executable code snippets

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Enhanced engagement**: Gamification increases motivation
- **Better learning outcomes**: Multiple assessment types validate understanding
- **Industry alignment**: Professional development practices
- **Scalability**: Framework supports individual and group learning
- **Data-driven insights**: Analytics inform curriculum improvements

### Negative
- **Complexity increase**: More components to maintain
- **Dependency management**: Additional libraries required
- **Storage requirements**: Progress tracking data accumulation
- **Performance considerations**: Interactive widgets resource usage

### Risks
- **Dependency conflicts**: ipywidgets, plotly compatibility
- **Browser compatibility**: Interactive elements may not work everywhere
- **Data privacy**: Student progress tracking requirements
- **Maintenance overhead**: Multiple integrated systems

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Existing LMS Integration (e.g., Moodle, Canvas)
**Rejected**: Would require significant customization and limit our ability to create semiconductor-specific interactive elements.

### Alternative 2: Simple Static Documentation
**Rejected**: Lacks interactivity and assessment capabilities needed for professional development.

### Alternative 3: Notebook-Only Approach
**Rejected**: Limited assessment capabilities and no cross-module progress tracking.

### Alternative 4: Third-party Educational Platform
**Rejected**: Expensive licensing and limited customization for semiconductor domain.

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Core Assessment Framework
- Implement `ModuleAssessment` and `ProgressTracker` classes
- JSON-based result storage for LMS compatibility
- Basic CLI interface for testing

### Phase 2: Interactive Components
- Develop ipywidgets for ML parameter tuning
- Create 3D wafer visualization components
- Integrate with existing pipeline architecture

### Phase 3: Gamification System
- Build achievement engine with comprehensive badge catalog
- Implement progress analytics and recommendations
- Create student dashboard and leaderboard systems

### Phase 4: Documentation Infrastructure
- Automated API documentation generation
- Architecture Decision Record system
- Integration with MkDocs for unified documentation

### Integration Points
- **Existing pipelines**: Assessment results integration
- **Jupyter notebooks**: Widget embedding
- **CLI tools**: Assessment running and progress tracking
- **Web interface**: Dashboard and visualization serving

### Data Storage Strategy
- **Local files**: JSON for individual development
- **Database support**: Future PostgreSQL/SQLite integration
- **Privacy compliance**: GDPR/FERPA considerations built-in

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Each component individually tested
- **Integration tests**: Cross-component functionality
- **Performance tests**: Widget loading and responsiveness
- **Accessibility tests**: WCAG 2.1 compliance verification
