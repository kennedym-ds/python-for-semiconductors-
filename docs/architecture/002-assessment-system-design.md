# ADR-002: Assessment System Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The learning series needs a comprehensive assessment system that validates student understanding across multiple dimensions:
- Theoretical knowledge of ML concepts
- Practical coding skills
- Real-world problem-solving abilities
- Semiconductor domain expertise

The system must support:
- Automated grading where possible
- Manual review for complex assessments
- Progress tracking across modules
- Industry-standard evaluation rubrics

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layered assessment system with the following architecture:

### 1. Assessment Types
```python
class AssessmentType(Enum):
    KNOWLEDGE_CHECK = "knowledge"      # Multiple choice, concept questions
    PRACTICAL_CODING = "practical"     # Hands-on coding exercises
    PROJECT_EVALUATION = "project"     # Real-world problem solving
    PEER_REVIEW = "peer"              # Collaborative assessments
```

### 2. Core Assessment Classes
- **Question**: Individual assessment items with metadata
- **AssessmentResult**: Standardized result format
- **ModuleAssessment**: Module-specific assessment orchestration
- **ProgressTracker**: Cross-module progress analytics

### 3. Grading Rubrics
#### Foundation Level (80% minimum)
- Basic concept understanding
- Code execution without errors
- Correct interpretation of results

#### Proficient Level (90% minimum)
- Advanced concept application
- Code optimization awareness
- Insightful analysis and conclusions

#### Expert Level (95+ minimum)
- Creative problem solving
- Industry best practices
- Innovation and original thinking

### 4. Semiconductor-Specific Metrics
- **PWS (Prediction Within Spec)**: Manufacturing tolerance compliance
- **Process Knowledge**: Understanding of semiconductor physics
- **Industry Relevance**: Real-world application accuracy

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Multiple dimensions of learning assessed
- **Industry alignment**: Metrics relevant to semiconductor manufacturing
- **Automated efficiency**: Reduces manual grading burden
- **Progress visibility**: Clear learning pathway tracking
- **Standardization**: Consistent evaluation criteria

### Negative
- **Development complexity**: Multiple assessment types to implement
- **Maintenance overhead**: Question banks need regular updates
- **Subjectivity risk**: Project evaluations may vary between reviewers
- **Technical dependency**: Requires robust execution environment

### Risks
- **Cheating potential**: Automated assessments may be gameable
- **Bias introduction**: Assessment design may favor certain learning styles
- **Technical failures**: Code execution environment issues
- **Scalability limits**: Manual review components don't scale

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Third-party Assessment Platform (e.g., CodeGrade, Gradescope)
**Rejected**: Limited customization for semiconductor-specific content and expensive licensing.

### Alternative 2: Simple Quiz-Based System
**Rejected**: Insufficient for practical skill validation in ML/semiconductor domain.

### Alternative 3: Manual-Only Assessment
**Rejected**: Does not scale and creates consistency issues across evaluators.

### Alternative 4: Peer-Assessment Only
**Rejected**: Quality control issues and potential for gaming the system.

## Implementation Notes

### Assessment Database Schema
```python
@dataclass
class Question:
    id: str
    type: str  # multiple_choice, coding, conceptual
    question: str
    options: Optional[List[str]]
    correct_answer: Optional[str]
    points: int
    difficulty: str
    topic: str
    semiconductor_context: str  # Specific industry relevance
```

### Automated Grading Framework
- **Syntax checking**: Python code validation
- **Output verification**: Expected result comparison
- **Performance metrics**: Execution time and memory usage
- **Code quality**: Basic style and structure analysis

### Manual Review Interface
- **Rubric-based scoring**: Standardized evaluation forms
- **Anonymous review**: Bias reduction through ID masking
- **Calibration exercises**: Reviewer training and consistency
- **Appeals process**: Student dispute resolution

### Progress Analytics
```python
class ProgressMetrics:
    - completion_rate: float
    - average_score: float
    - time_to_completion: timedelta
    - strength_areas: List[str]
    - improvement_areas: List[str]
    - industry_readiness_score: float
```

### Integration with Gamification
- **Achievement triggers**: Assessment performance milestones
- **Badge criteria**: Multi-assessment accomplishments
- **Leaderboard metrics**: Fair comparison across different paths
- **Recommendation engine**: Personalized next steps

### Quality Assurance
- **Question validation**: Expert review before deployment
- **Statistical analysis**: Item difficulty and discrimination
- **Feedback incorporation**: Continuous improvement based on student input
- **A/B testing**: Assessment format optimization

### Accessibility Compliance
- **Screen reader support**: All assessment content compatible
- **Extended time options**: Accommodations for different needs
- **Alternative formats**: Multiple ways to demonstrate knowledge
- **Language support**: Clear, technical language with definitions

### Security Measures
- **Time limits**: Prevent extensive external resource use
- **Code execution sandboxing**: Safe evaluation environment
- **Plagiarism detection**: Similarity analysis for coding submissions
- **Browser lockdown**: Optional secure testing environment
