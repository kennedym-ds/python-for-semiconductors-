## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Test Architecture
**Decision**: Use pytest fixtures for data generation  
**Rationale**: Promotes code reuse, makes tests more maintainable  
**Implementation**: Each test class has fixtures for sample data, trained models

### 2. Realistic Implementations
**Decision**: Implement working versions of components (not mocks)  
**Rationale**: Validates actual implementation patterns, serves as reference  
**Examples**: SimpleCache, QuantizedModel, BatchProcessor

### 3. Semiconductor Context
**Decision**: Include domain-specific scenarios in every test suite  
**Rationale**: Ensures tests are relevant to target users (semiconductor engineers)  
**Examples**: Wafer defect co-occurrence, inline inspection, equipment monitoring

### 4. Tolerance Handling
**Decision**: Add small tolerances for floating-point comparisons  
**Rationale**: Prevents flaky tests due to numerical precision  
**Implementation**: Use ~0.01 tolerance for timing, 0.99 multiplier for p95 latency

## Lessons Learned

### Quantization Edge Cases
**Issue**: Division by zero when all weights are identical  
**Solution**: Check `w_max == w_min` before calculating scale  
**Impact**: Prevents NaN values in quantized models

### Statistical Sample Size
**Issue**: Z-score anomaly detection unreliable with <10 samples  
**Solution**: Increased sample size to 10 for reliable statistics  
**Impact**: More robust anomaly detection tests

### sklearn API Variations
**Issue**: ClassifierChain returns float64 instead of int sometimes  
**Solution**: Accept multiple valid types in assertions  
**Impact**: Tests now handle sklearn version differences

### Timing Variance
**Issue**: Latency measurements can have small variance  
**Solution**: Use 99% tolerance for p95 >= mean comparisons  
**Impact**: Eliminates flaky tests on different hardware

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ

- Code quality: All pre-commit hooks passing

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Notebook execution: Depends on kernel state management
- Documentation: Time-intensive research and writing

### Mitigation Strategies

The repository is now **85% complete** toward v1.0 release. Remaining work focuses on:
1. Assessment system integration tests (high priority)
2. CI/CD pipeline updates (high priority)
3. Documentation enhancement (medium priority)
4. Notebook execution tests (medium priority)

**Projected v1.0 Release**: October 6-7, 2025 (4-5 days)
