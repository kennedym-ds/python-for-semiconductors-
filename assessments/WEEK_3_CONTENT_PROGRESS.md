      def get_percentiles(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
          # Returns p50, p95, p99, mean
  ```
  - Tracks last 1000 requests
  - Calculates percentiles (p50, p95, p99, mean)
  - Visualizes latency distribution histogram
  - Shows latency over time with p95 line

- **Caching with TTL**:
  ```python
  class CachedModelServer:
      def __init__(self, cache_ttl_seconds=60):
          self.cache: Dict[str, CacheEntry] = {}

      def predict(self, features, use_cache=True):
          # Check cache validity, return cached result if fresh
  ```
