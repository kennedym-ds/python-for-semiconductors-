    {
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "A strong answer should mention: (1) Unsupervised learning approaches like isolation forests or autoencoders since normal patterns may vary; (2) Semiconductor-specific factors like tool-to-tool variation, recipe changes requiring model adaptation, and the cost of false alarms halting production; (3) Deployment considerations including model retraining frequency, integration with existing MES systems, and establishing appropriate alert thresholds to balance detection vs. false positives.",

        "Consider that you may not have labeled examples of all anomaly types",
        "Think about the cost of stopping production for a false alarm",
