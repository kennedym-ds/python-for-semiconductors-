### Quick Start

#### 1. Train a GAN Model
```bash
# Basic training (CPU-friendly)
python 8.1-gans-data-augmentation-pipeline.py train \
    --epochs 50 \
    --batch-size 32 \
    --image-size 64 \
    --save wafer_gan.joblib

# GPU training for better quality
python 8.1-gans-data-augmentation-pipeline.py train \
    --epochs 200 \
    --batch-size 128 \
    --device cuda \
    --save production_gan.joblib
```

#### 2. Generate Synthetic Samples
```bash
# Generate augmentation data
python 8.1-gans-data-augmentation-pipeline.py generate \
    --model-path wafer_gan.joblib \
    --num-samples 100 \
    --output-grid samples.png
```

#### 3. Evaluate Quality
```bash
# Assess model quality
python 8.1-gans-data-augmentation-pipeline.py evaluate \
    --model-path wafer_gan.joblib
```

### Architecture Overview

**Generator Network:**
- Transforms 100D latent vectors to 64×64 grayscale images
- Uses transposed convolutions for upsampling
- Batch normalization and ReLU activations
- Tanh output for normalized range [-1, 1]

**Discriminator Network:**
- Binary classifier for real vs. generated images
- Standard convolutions with stride 2 for downsampling
- LeakyReLU activations and batch normalization
- Sigmoid output for probability estimation

**Training Process:**
1. Train discriminator to distinguish real from fake
2. Train generator to fool the discriminator
3. Alternate until convergence (typically 50-200 epochs)

### Key Capabilities

#### Data Augmentation
- Generate synthetic wafer maps to balance datasets
- Supplement rare defect patterns for improved classification
- Create diverse patterns for robust model training

#### Quality Evaluation
- Visual inspection grids for human evaluation
- Quantitative metrics (sample statistics, optional FID/KID)
- Downstream task performance validation

#### Production Features
- Model persistence with joblib
- Reproducible training with fixed seeds
- CPU and GPU compatibility
- Comprehensive error handling

### Performance Characteristics

| Configuration | Training Time | Quality | Use Case |
|---------------|---------------|---------|----------|
| CPU, 32×32, 30 epochs | ~15 minutes | Good for prototyping | Development/Testing |
| CPU, 64×64, 50 epochs | ~45 minutes | Moderate quality | Educational use |
| GPU, 64×64, 200 epochs | ~30 minutes | Production quality | Real applications |

### Integration Examples

#### Data Augmentation Pipeline
```python
from pathlib import Path
from gans_pipeline import GANsPipeline

# Train GAN on existing data
pipeline = GANsPipeline(image_size=64, batch_size=32)
pipeline.fit(data_path='datasets/real_wafers', epochs=100)

# Generate augmentation samples
synthetic_samples = pipeline.generate(num_samples=500)

# Save for downstream use
pipeline.save(Path('augmentation_gan.joblib'))
```

#### Research Workflow
```python
# Load pre-trained model
pipeline = GANsPipeline.load(Path('trained_model.joblib'))

# Generate samples for analysis
samples = pipeline.generate(100)

# Evaluate quality
metrics = pipeline.evaluate()
print(f"Quality score: {metrics['metrics']['sample_std']:.3f}")
```

### Testing and Validation

The module includes comprehensive tests that validate:
- Training convergence and stability
- Sample generation functionality
- Model save/load operations
- CLI interface and error handling
- Performance under time constraints (< 60s for test suite)

Run tests with:
```bash
python -m pytest test_gans_augmentation_pipeline.py -v
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
1. **Training instability**: Reduce learning rates, balance generator/discriminator
2. **Mode collapse**: Increase diversity regularization, try different architectures
3. **Memory errors**: Reduce batch size or image resolution
4. **Poor quality**: Train longer, use more data, tune hyperparameters

#### Performance Optimization
- Use GPU for faster training when available
- Start with 32×32 images for rapid prototyping
- Batch generation for efficient sample creation
- Consider model quantization for deployment
