# Module 9.1 – Model Deployment Fundamentals for Semiconductor Manufacturing

## 1. Introduction to ML Model Deployment

Model deployment transforms trained ML models from experimental artifacts into production-ready services that deliver business value. In semiconductor manufacturing, this means integrating predictive models into real-time decision-making systems for process control, quality assurance, and yield optimization.

### Why Deployment Matters in Semiconductor Manufacturing

- **Real-time Process Control**: Models must respond within milliseconds to adjust process parameters
- **High Availability Requirements**: Manufacturing lines run 24/7; model downtime costs millions
- **Integration Complexity**: Models interface with MES, SCADA, and legacy fab systems
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Deployment must maintain audit trails and version control
- **Scalability**: Support multiple fabs, tool sets, and production recipes simultaneously

## 2. Deployment Architecture Patterns

### Microservices Architecture

The recommended pattern for semiconductor ML deployment uses containerized microservices:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Data Ingress  │───▶│   ML Service    │───▶│   Decision      │
│   (SECS/GEM)    │    │   (FastAPI)     │    │   Engine        │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                               │
                       ┌───────▼─────────┐
                       │   Model Store   │
                       │   (Versioned)   │
                       └─────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Independent scaling of model inference vs. data processing
- A/B testing capabilities for model versions
- Fault isolation between services
- Technology stack flexibility per service

### API-First Design

RESTful APIs provide a standard interface for model consumption:

- **Synchronous Predictions**: `/predict` for real-time decisions (< 100ms)
- **Batch Processing**: `/batch_predict` for historical analysis
- **Health Monitoring**: `/health` for service orchestration
- **Model Metadata**: `/version` for audit and debugging

## 3. Containerization with Docker

### Container Benefits for ML Deployment

1. **Reproducibility**: Identical environments across dev/staging/production
2. **Isolation**: Model dependencies don't conflict with system libraries
3. **Portability**: Deploy consistently across on-premises and cloud
4. **Resource Management**: Control CPU, memory, and GPU allocation
5. **Orchestration**: Enable Kubernetes-based auto-scaling

### Docker Best Practices for ML Models

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage builds reduce image size
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --user -r requirements.txt

FROM python:3.11-slim
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
# Add security: non-root user
RUN useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash model-user
USER model-user
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Never run containers as root
- Use minimal base images (slim, alpine)
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Implement read-only filesystems where possible

## 4. Model Versioning and Lifecycle Management

### Semantic Versioning for Models

Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with ML-specific semantics:

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes (input/output schema)
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible functionality (new features, performance improvements)
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes (model retraining with same data)

### Model Artifact Management

Each deployment package contains:

```
deployment_v1_2_0/
├── model.joblib          # Serialized model
├── metadata.json         # Version, schema, metrics
├── requirements.txt      # Dependency specification
├── validation.json       # Test cases and expected outputs
└── docs/                 # Model documentation
    ├── performance.md    # Benchmark results
    └── changelog.md      # Version history
```

### Deployment Strategies

**Blue-Green Deployment:**
- Run two identical production environments
- Switch traffic atomically between versions
- Immediate rollback capability
- Zero-downtime deployments

**Canary Deployment:**
- Route small percentage of traffic to new version
- Monitor key metrics (accuracy, latency, errors)
- Gradually increase traffic if metrics are healthy
- Automatic rollback on threshold violations

## 5. Input Validation and Error Handling

### Schema Validation with Pydantic

Validate inputs at the API boundary to prevent model failures:

```python
class ProcessParameters(BaseModel):
    temperature: float = Field(ge=300, le=600)  # Valid range
    pressure: float = Field(ge=0.1, le=10.0)
    flow_rate: float = Field(gt=0)
    
    @validator('temperature')
    def validate_temperature_stability(cls, v):
        # Custom business logic validation
        if v > 550:
            warnings.warn("High temperature may affect yield")
        return v
```

### Error Response Patterns

Standardize error responses for client integration:

```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "details": {
    "temperature": "Value 700 exceeds maximum of 600",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "request_id": "req_123456",
  "retry_after": 1000
}
```

## 6. Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics for Production ML

**Infrastructure Metrics:**
- Response time (p50, p95, p99 percentiles)
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Error rate and error types
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, GPU)

**Model Performance Metrics:**
- Prediction accuracy vs. ground truth (when available)
- Data drift detection (input distribution changes)
- Model drift detection (prediction distribution changes)
- Feature importance changes over time

**Business Metrics:**
- Yield improvement attribution
- Cost savings from defect prediction
- Process optimization success rate

### Alerting Strategy

**Tiered Alert Levels:**
1. **Critical**: Service down, high error rate (> 5%)
2. **Warning**: Performance degradation, elevated latency
3. **Info**: Model drift detected, retraining recommended

### Logging Best Practices

```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

def predict_endpoint(request):
    logger.info("prediction_request", 
               request_id=request.id,
               model_version=model.version,
               input_features=request.features)
    
    try:
        prediction = model.predict(request.features)
        logger.info("prediction_success",
                   request_id=request.id,
                   prediction=prediction,
                   confidence=confidence)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error("prediction_failed",
                    request_id=request.id,
                    error=str(e),
                    traceback=traceback.format_exc())
```

## 7. Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization

**API Keys:**
- Rotate keys regularly (monthly/quarterly)
- Scope keys to specific endpoints
- Log all API key usage

**Network Security:**
- TLS encryption for all endpoints
- Network segmentation (VPCs, firewalls)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

**Data Protection:**
- No sensitive data in logs
- Encrypt model artifacts at rest
- Secure model loading (verify checksums)

### Compliance and Audit

**FDA/ISO Requirements:**
- Complete audit trail of model versions
- Validation documentation for each deployment
- Change control processes
- Risk assessment documentation

## 8. Performance Optimization

### Model Serving Optimization

**Batch Processing:**
- Group multiple predictions to reduce overhead
- Optimal batch sizes (typically 32-128 samples)
- Async processing for non-critical paths

**Model Optimization:**
- Quantization (float32 → float16/int8)
- Model pruning (remove unnecessary parameters)
- ONNX conversion for hardware acceleration
- TensorRT optimization for GPU inference

### Caching Strategies

**Result Caching:**
- Cache frequent predictions (LRU cache)
- Consider cache invalidation policies
- Monitor cache hit rates

**Model Caching:**
- Keep models warm in memory
- Lazy loading for infrequent models
- Model sharing across workers

## 9. Scaling Strategies

### Horizontal Scaling

**Load Balancing:**
- Round-robin for uniform workloads
- Weighted routing for A/B testing
- Health check integration

**Auto-scaling:**
- CPU/memory-based scaling
- Custom metrics (queue depth, response time)
- Predictive scaling based on production schedules

### Edge Deployment

For ultra-low latency requirements:
- Deploy models at edge compute nodes
- Reduced model complexity for edge constraints
- Federated learning for distributed improvement

## 10. Deployment Pipeline Integration

### CI/CD for ML Models

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
name: Model Deployment Pipeline
on:
  push:
    paths: ['models/**']

jobs:
  validate:
    - name: Model Validation
      run: python validate_model.py
    - name: Performance Benchmarks
      run: python benchmark_model.py
  
  staging_deploy:
    - name: Deploy to Staging
      run: docker build -t model:staging .
    - name: Integration Tests
      run: pytest tests/integration/
  
  production_deploy:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    - name: Production Deployment
      run: kubectl apply -f k8s/production/
```

### Infrastructure as Code

Use Terraform/CloudFormation to manage:
- Container orchestration (EKS, GKE, AKS)
- Load balancers and networking
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Storage for models and artifacts

## 11. Future Considerations

## 12. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Model Loading Failures
- **Symptom**: Service starts but predictions fail
- **Causes**: Version mismatch, corrupted artifacts, missing dependencies
- **Solutions**: Checksum validation, dependency locking, graceful degradation

### Performance Degradation
- **Symptom**: Increasing response times
- **Causes**: Memory leaks, model drift, infrastructure load
- **Solutions**: Resource monitoring, model retraining, horizontal scaling

### Data Drift
- **Symptom**: Accuracy decline over time
- **Causes**: Process changes, seasonal effects, equipment drift
- **Solutions**: Automated drift detection, retraining triggers, alert systems

This comprehensive approach to model deployment ensures that ML models transition successfully from development to production while maintaining the reliability, security, and performance standards required in semiconductor manufacturing environments.
