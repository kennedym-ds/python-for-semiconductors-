# Module 7.1: Advanced Defect Detection Fundamentals

## Overview

Advanced defect detection in semiconductor manufacturing is critical for ensuring product quality and minimizing yield losses. This module covers object detection techniques for identifying and localizing defects such as scratches, particles, and cracks on wafer surfaces.

## Object Detection Fundamentals

### What is Object Detection?

Object detection combines two computer vision tasks:
1. **Classification**: What objects are in the image?
2. **Localization**: Where are the objects located?

The output is a set of bounding boxes with associated class labels and confidence scores.

### Key Metrics for Object Detection

#### Intersection over Union (IoU)
IoU measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes:

```
IoU = Area of Intersection / Area of Union
```

- IoU = 1.0: Perfect overlap
- IoU = 0.0: No overlap
- Common threshold: IoU ≥ 0.5 for "correct" detection

#### Mean Average Precision (mAP)
- **Precision**: TP / (TP + FP) - What fraction of detections are correct?
- **Recall**: TP / (TP + FN) - What fraction of ground truth objects are detected?
- **Average Precision (AP)**: Area under the Precision-Recall curve
- **mAP**: Mean AP across all classes
- **mAP@0.5**: mAP with IoU threshold of 0.5

#### Semiconductor-Specific Metrics

**Prediction Within Spec (PWS)**
```
PWS = (True Positives / Total Detections) × 100%
```
Percentage of correctly identified defects.

**Estimated Loss**
```
Estimated Loss = (False Negatives × Defect Cost) + (False Positives × False Alarm Cost)
```
Economic impact of detection errors in manufacturing context.

## Detection Architectures

### 1. Classical Computer Vision Approach

Traditional methods using OpenCV and image processing:

**Advantages:**
- Fast inference (CPU-friendly)
- No training data required
- Interpretable results
- Low memory footprint

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited accuracy on complex defects
- Requires manual parameter tuning
- Sensitive to lighting variations

**Typical Pipeline:**
1. Preprocessing (blur, noise reduction)
2. Edge detection (Canny, Sobel)
3. Morphological operations
4. Contour detection
5. Feature-based classification

### 2. YOLO (You Only Look Once)

Single-shot detection architecture that predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly.

**Advantages:**
- Real-time inference
- End-to-end training
- Good balance of speed vs accuracy
- Suitable for production deployment

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires large training datasets
- May struggle with small objects
- Less precise localization than two-stage methods

**Architecture Overview:**
- Input image → CNN backbone → Detection head
- Grid-based prediction system
- Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) for duplicate removal

### 3. Faster R-CNN

Two-stage detection architecture with Region Proposal Network (RPN).

**Advantages:**
- High accuracy
- Excellent localization precision
- Good performance on small objects
- Well-suited for complex defect patterns

**Disadvantages:**
- Slower inference than single-shot methods
- More complex training process
- Higher memory requirements

**Architecture Overview:**
1. **Stage 1**: RPN generates object proposals
2. **Stage 2**: Classification and bounding box regression

## Semiconductor Defect Types

### 1. Scratches
- **Characteristics**: Linear defects caused by mechanical damage
- **Detection Challenge**: Variable length and orientation
- **Classical Approach**: Line detection algorithms (Hough transform)
- **Deep Learning**: Benefits from learned orientation invariance

### 2. Particles
- **Characteristics**: Circular or irregular foreign matter
- **Detection Challenge**: Size variation and irregular shapes
- **Classical Approach**: Blob detection, connected components
- **Deep Learning**: Robust to shape variations

### 3. Cracks
- **Characteristics**: Irregular fracture patterns
- **Detection Challenge**: Thin, branching structures
- **Classical Approach**: Edge detection with morphological operations
- **Deep Learning**: Learns complex crack patterns

## Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)

NMS removes duplicate detections by:
1. Sort detections by confidence score
2. Keep highest confidence detection
3. Remove all detections with IoU > threshold with kept detection
4. Repeat until all detections processed

**Parameters:**
- **Confidence Threshold**: Minimum confidence to consider
- **NMS Threshold**: IoU threshold for suppression (typically 0.4-0.6)

## Anchors and Multi-Scale Detection

### Anchor Boxes
Pre-defined bounding box templates at different scales and aspect ratios:
- **Scale**: Different sizes to detect objects of various dimensions
- **Aspect Ratio**: Different shapes (1:1, 1:2, 2:1, etc.)
- **Multiple Anchors**: Per grid cell to handle overlapping objects

### Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN)
Multi-scale feature extraction for detecting objects at different sizes:
- **High Resolution + Low Semantics**: Detect small objects
- **Low Resolution + High Semantics**: Detect large objects
- **Lateral Connections**: Combine features across scales

## Training Considerations

### Data Augmentation
Essential for robust defect detection:
- **Geometric**: Rotation, scaling, translation, flipping
- **Photometric**: Brightness, contrast, noise addition
- **Synthetic Data**: Generated defects for data augmentation

### Loss Functions

**Classification Loss**: Cross-entropy for object categories
**Localization Loss**: Smooth L1 or IoU-based loss for bounding boxes
**Focal Loss**: Addresses class imbalance in dense prediction

### Transfer Learning
Starting from pre-trained models (ImageNet, COCO):
1. **Feature Extraction**: Freeze backbone, train detection head
2. **Fine-tuning**: Gradually unfreeze layers for domain adaptation
3. **Domain-Specific**: Train from scratch on semiconductor data

## Deployment Considerations

### CPU vs GPU Inference
- **CPU**: Classical methods, optimized YOLO models
- **GPU**: Full deep learning models, batch processing
- **Edge Devices**: Quantized models, pruned networks

### Real-Time Constraints
- **Throughput**: Wafers per minute processing requirement
- **Latency**: Time from image capture to defect detection
- **Accuracy vs Speed**: Trade-off based on production needs

### Model Optimization
- **Quantization**: Reduce precision (FP32 → INT8)
- **Pruning**: Remove redundant network connections
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Train smaller models from larger teachers
- **ONNX/TensorRT**: Optimize for specific hardware

## Quality Control Integration

### Statistical Process Control
- **Control Charts**: Monitor detection performance over time
- **Baseline Metrics**: Establish normal operation parameters
- **Drift Detection**: Identify when retraining is needed

### False Positive Management
- **Cost Analysis**: Balance missed defects vs false alarms
- **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust confidence based on production requirements
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Route uncertain detections to operators

### Continuous Learning
- **Active Learning**: Select most informative samples for labeling

## Best Practices
