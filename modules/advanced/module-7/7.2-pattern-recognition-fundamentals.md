## Technical Approaches

### Classical Computer Vision Features

#### Spatial Distribution Features

### Deep Learning Approaches

#### Compact CNN Architecture
```python
class CompactCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=5):
        # 3 convolutional layers with max pooling
        # Dropout for regularization  
        # Fully connected classification head
```

**Advantages:**

## Manufacturing-Specific Metrics

### Standard Classification Metrics

- **PR-AUC**: Precision-recall balance for rare patterns
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Semiconductor-Specific Metrics

#### Prediction Within Spec (PWS)
```python
def compute_pws(y_true, y_pred, tolerance=0.0):
    """For classification: exact match required (tolerance=0)"""
    return np.mean(y_true == y_pred)
```

#### Estimated Loss (Manufacturing Cost Impact)
```python
def compute_estimated_loss(y_true, y_pred, cost_matrix):
    """Expected cost based on misclassification matrix"""
    total_cost = 0
    for true_label, pred_label in zip(y_true, y_pred):
        total_cost += cost_matrix[true_label][pred_label]
    return total_cost / len(y_true)
```

**Cost Matrix Considerations:**
- **False Negative Cost**: Missing critical defects (high cost)

    pattern_prediction = model.predict(wafer_map)
    confidence = model.predict_proba(wafer_map).max()
    
    if pattern_prediction == "Scratch" and confidence > 0.8:
        return {"action": "HOLD_LOT", "reason": "Scratch pattern detected"}
    elif pattern_prediction == "Center" and confidence > 0.7:
        return {"action": "REWORK", "reason": "Center pattern - check chuck"}
    else:
        return {"action": "CONTINUE", "reason": "Normal processing"}
```
