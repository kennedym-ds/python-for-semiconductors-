## 📊 The Six Dimensions of Data Quality

### 1. Completeness

**Definition**: The degree to which all required data is present and available for analysis.

**Mathematical Representation**:
```
Completeness = (Total Values - Missing Values) / Total Values × 100%
```

**Manufacturing Context**:
- **Sensor Data**: Missing measurements due to equipment failures
- **Process Parameters**: Incomplete recording during shift changes
- **Quality Metrics**: Gaps in inspection data during maintenance

**Assessment Methods**:
- Missing value percentage by column
- Missing value patterns (random vs. systematic)
- Completeness trends over time
- Critical path analysis for essential parameters

**Industry Standards**:
- **Critical Parameters**: >95% completeness required
- **Standard Parameters**: >90% completeness acceptable
- **Optional Parameters**: >80% completeness sufficient

### 2. Accuracy

**Definition**: The degree to which data correctly represents the real-world values being measured.

**Statistical Measures**:
- **Precision**: Consistency of repeated measurements
- **Bias**: Systematic deviation from true values
- **Uncertainty**: Range of possible error in measurements

**Manufacturing Sources of Inaccuracy**:
- **Calibration Drift**: Sensors losing accuracy over time
- **Environmental Effects**: Temperature, humidity variations
- **Human Error**: Manual data entry mistakes
- **System Noise**: Electronic interference in measurements

**Detection Methods**:
- Statistical outlier detection (Z-score, IQR method)
- Control chart analysis for sensor drift
- Cross-validation with reference standards
- Process physics validation (thermodynamic consistency)

### 3. Consistency

**Definition**: The degree to which data is uniform across different sources, time periods, and measurement systems.

**Types of Inconsistency**:
- **Format Inconsistency**: Different units, scales, representations
- **Temporal Inconsistency**: Values changing unexpectedly over time
- **Cross-Source Inconsistency**: Different systems measuring same parameter differently

**Manufacturing Examples**:
- Temperature sensors using Celsius vs. Fahrenheit
- Pressure measurements in different units (psi, bar, Pascal)
- Different sampling frequencies across similar tools

**Assessment Techniques**:
- Cross-correlation analysis between similar sensors
- Unit conversion validation
- Time series consistency checks
- Inter-tool correlation studies

### 4. Validity

**Definition**: The degree to which data conforms to defined formats, ranges, and business rules.

**Validation Categories**:

**Format Validation**:
- Data type checking (numeric, categorical, boolean)
- Range validation (physical limits, process constraints)
- Pattern validation (sensor naming conventions, ID formats)

**Domain Validation**:
- Physical constraints (temperature cannot be below absolute zero)
- Process constraints (pressure cannot exceed tool specifications)
- Logical constraints (flow rate must be positive)

**Business Rule Validation**:
- Recipe compliance (parameters within specified ranges)
- Quality standards (measurements within control limits)
- Safety constraints (critical parameters within safe operating ranges)

### 5. Uniqueness

**Definition**: The degree to which data records are distinct and non-duplicated.

**Types of Duplication**:
- **Exact Duplicates**: Identical records across all fields
- **Near Duplicates**: Records with minor differences (timestamp variations)
- **Logical Duplicates**: Different representations of same event

**Manufacturing Contexts**:
- Multiple systems logging the same process event
- Data transmission errors creating duplicate records
- Batch processing creating redundant entries

**Detection Methods**:
- Hash-based exact duplicate detection
- Similarity-based near-duplicate detection
- Time-window based logical duplicate identification

### 6. Timeliness

**Definition**: The degree to which data is current, up-to-date, and available when needed.

**Temporal Aspects**:
- **Data Freshness**: How recent is the data?
- **Update Frequency**: How often is data refreshed?
- **Availability**: Is data accessible when needed?

**Manufacturing Requirements**:
- **Real-time Process Control**: Sub-second data latency
- **Statistical Process Control**: Hourly to daily updates
- **Yield Analysis**: Daily to weekly reporting cycles

## 🔬 Statistical Methods for Data Quality Assessment

### Missing Data Analysis

**Missing Data Mechanisms**:

1. **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**
   - Missing values are independent of observed and unobserved data
   - Example: Random sensor failures
   - Test: Little's MCAR test

2. **Missing at Random (MAR)**
   - Missing values depend on observed data but not unobserved data
   - Example: Sensor failures correlated with operating conditions
   - Handling: Multiple imputation, maximum likelihood

3. **Missing Not at Random (MNAR)**
   - Missing values depend on unobserved data
   - Example: Sensors failing when values exceed measurement range
   - Handling: Domain knowledge, pattern modeling

**Statistical Tests**:

```python
# Little's MCAR Test (conceptual)
def littles_mcar_test(data):
    """
    Test null hypothesis that data is MCAR
    H0: Data is MCAR
    H1: Data is not MCAR
    """
    # Implementation would use likelihood ratio test
    # comparing observed vs expected missing patterns
    pass
```

### Outlier Detection Methods

**Statistical Approaches**:

1. **Z-Score Method**
   ```
   Z = (x - μ) / σ
   Outlier if |Z| > threshold (typically 2.5 or 3)
   ```

2. **Interquartile Range (IQR) Method**
   ```
   IQR = Q3 - Q1
   Lower bound = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR
   Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR
   ```

3. **Modified Z-Score (Robust)**
   ```
   Modified Z = 0.6745 × (x - median) / MAD
   where MAD = median absolute deviation
   ```

**Machine Learning Approaches**:

1. **Isolation Forest**
   - Isolates anomalies using random forests
   - Effective for high-dimensional data
   - No assumption about data distribution

2. **One-Class SVM**
   - Learns boundary around normal data
   - Effective for complex, non-linear patterns
   - Requires parameter tuning

3. **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**
   - Measures local density deviation
   - Good for clustered data with varying densities

### Distribution Analysis

**Normality Testing**:
- **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: Best for small samples (n < 50)
- **Anderson-Darling Test**: Good for larger samples
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: General goodness-of-fit test

**Distribution Fitting**:
```python
from scipy import stats

# Common distributions in manufacturing
distributions = [
    stats.norm,      # Normal (measurement errors)
    stats.lognorm,   # Log-normal (particle sizes)
    stats.weibull_min, # Weibull (reliability data)
    stats.gamma,     # Gamma (waiting times)
    stats.beta       # Beta (proportions, yields)
]
```
