# Module 4.1 – Ensemble Methods for Advanced Yield Modeling

## 1. Motivation: Why Ensembles in Semiconductor Analytics

Modern semiconductor fabs generate high-dimensional, heterogeneous, noisy data (inline metrology, wafer sort parametrics, equipment sensors, defect inspection, spatial maps). Single estimators often struggle to simultaneously:

- Capture non-linear interactions (e.g., tool × recipe × layer interactions).
- Remain robust to missingness, outliers, and mixed feature scales.
- Generalize across time (tool drifts, engineering change notices) without fragile parametric assumptions.

Ensembles reduce generalization error by aggregating multiple inductive biases and decorrelating individual learner errors. They are now standard for:

- Predicting final yield/parametric KPIs early (cycle time reduction).
- Excursion detection / anomaly ranking using class probability calibration.
- Predictive maintenance (time-to-failure regression/classification on sensor aggregates).
- Virtual metrology (estimating downstream measurements to optimize sampling costs).

## 2. Bias–Variance Framing

Let the true function be f, model prediction \( \hat f \), training set \( D \). The expected generalization error decomposes:

\[ E_{D,x}[(\hat f_D(x) - f(x))^2] = (Bias[\hat f(x)])^2 + Var[\hat f(x)] + \sigma^2_{irreducible} \]

Ensemble categories manipulate this balance:

- Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation): Lowers variance by averaging noisy, high-variance base learners (deep trees). Slight bias increase minimal if trees are unpruned.
- Boosting: Sequentially reduces bias via additive learners focused on residuals (gradient direction). Can raise variance if learners overfit; controlled by shrinkage and regularization.
- Stacking / Blending: Attempts to reduce both bias and variance by learning optimal convex (or constrained) combinations of heterogeneous model families.

## 3. Bagging Mechanics (Random Forest)

Random Forest (RF) algorithm steps:

1. For each tree b=1..B: sample bootstrap dataset (size N with replacement).
2. Grow an unpruned tree; at each split consider only m_try random features (decorrelates trees).
3. Aggregate: regression uses mean \( \hat f(x)=\frac{1}{B}\sum_{b} T_b(x) \); classification uses majority vote or averaged probabilities.

Key decorrelation levers: bootstrap sampling (row perturbation), feature subsampling (column perturbation), randomness in impurity ties. Reduced correlation shrinks ensemble variance faster with B.

Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error: For each observation, predict using only trees where it was not included (≈36.8% omission probability per tree). Provides nearly unbiased validation without a holdout set—useful when wafer counts limited.

Semiconductor Use Cases:

- Robust yield prediction with mixed categorical (tool IDs) + continuous (process temps) + engineered (temporal aggregates).
- Fast baseline for feature importance triage before expensive boosting or deep architectures.

## 4. Boosting Families Overview

All gradient boosting variants optimize an additive model:

\[ F_0(x) = \arg\min_c \sum_i L(y_i, c) \]
\[ F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \eta \cdot w_m h_m(x) \]

Where: \( h_m \) is a weak learner (typically shallow tree), \( \eta \) (learning rate) = shrinkage, \( w_m \) scaling weight from line search or closed form under second-order approximation, and L is differentiable loss (e.g., squared error, logistic, Poisson, gamma).

### 4.1 Classical Gradient Boosting (Friedman)

- Fits residuals or negative gradients of loss at each stage.
- Sensitive to correlated features and noise; requires careful depth + shrinkage tuning.
- Implementations: `sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoosting*` (slower, exact splits), superseded by histogram-based methods for large tabular data.

### 4.2 Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting (sklearn HistGradientBoosting)

- Pre-bins continuous features → constant-time split evaluation per bin.
- Uses monotonic constraints (semiconductor domain: known monotonic yield responses vs. certain process parameters) to enforce physics/engineering priors.
- Native missing value handling (NA as separate branch) beneficial for sparse sensor availability.

### 4.3 XGBoost Internals

Objective with regularization:
\[ Obj = \sum_{i} L(y_i, \hat y_i^{(t-1)} + f_t(x_i)) + \Omega(f_t), \quad \Omega(f) = \gamma T + \frac{1}{2}\lambda \sum_{j} w_j^2 \]

Second-order Taylor expansion of loss yields per-leaf optimal weight:
\[ w_j^* = - \frac{\sum_{i\in j} g_i}{\sum_{i\in j} h_i + \lambda} \]
Gain for split (left/right children L,R):
\[ Gain = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{G_L^2}{H_L+\lambda} + \frac{G_R^2}{H_R+\lambda} - \frac{(G_L+G_R)^2}{H_L+H_R+\lambda} \right) - \gamma \]

Where \( g_i = \partial_{\hat y} L \), \( h_i = \partial^2_{\hat y} L \). Regularization terms (λ, γ) penalize complexity (leaf weights, number of leaves).

Performance Accelerants:

- Column (feature) subsampling per tree & per split (reduces correlation, overfitting, runtime).
- Block structure & compressed column storage.
- Approximate split finding via quantile sketches for high cardinality features.
- Cache-aware prefetching.

### 4.4 LightGBM Innovations

Distinct innovations for further speed/scaling:

- Leaf-wise (best-first) growth with max_depth constraint: deeper along most gainful path → higher accuracy with fewer trees; must constrain to avoid overfitting on noisy parametrics.
- Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS): keep instances with large gradient magnitude, subsample small-gradient ones with probability adjustment → preserves training signal.
- Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB): merges mutually exclusive sparse features (e.g., encoded categorical buckets) into single dense feature → memory/time reduction.
- Native categorical feature handling (ordered statistics) reduces need for one-hot, lowering dimensionality.

### 4.5 Comparative Notes

| Aspect | RF | HistGB | XGBoost | LightGBM |
|--------|----|--------|---------|----------|
| Primary Strength | Variance reduction | Speed + constraints | Accuracy + control | Speed + large-scale |
| Handles Missing | Surrogate splits (indirect) | Native | Native | Native |
| Monotonic Constraints | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Cat Handling | One-hot/encoding | Encode externally | One-hot / target encode | Native (efficient) |
| Overfit Risk | Low-moderate | Moderate | Moderate-high | High if depth unconstrained |
| Typical Tuning Load | Low | Medium | High | High |

## 5. Core Concepts Glossary

- Shrinkage (Learning Rate η): Scales each additive tree. Lower η → need more trees but better generalization; trade-off with computation.
- Subsampling (Row): Stochastic gradient boosting to reduce variance & speed (XGBoost: subsample, LightGBM: bagging_fraction + bagging_freq).
- Column Subsampling: Feature subsampling per level/split reduces correlation (XGBoost: colsample_*, LightGBM: feature_fraction).
- Regularization: L1/L2 penalties on leaf weights (XGBoost: alpha, lambda), minimal gain constraints (gamma, min_gain_to_split), tree complexity via max_depth, min_child_weight.
- Minimum Child Samples/Weight: Prevents leaves with too few wafers (guards against modeling noise excursions).
- Monotonic Constraints: Encode domain priors (e.g., beyond certain over-etch time yield strictly decreases). Avoids implausible oscillatory responses.

## 6. Histogram Acceleration Rationale

Exact split finding scales poorly with many numeric features. Histogram-based algorithms:

1. Bin continuous features into k discrete bins (e.g., 256) using global quantiles.
2. Accumulate gradient/hessian sums per bin.
3. Evaluate splits over cumulative bin statistics O(k) rather than O(N) per feature.

Semiconductor context: Large wafer history tables (millions of rows) + wide engineered features (lag/rolling stats) make histogram methods essential for feasible experimentation cycles.

## 7. Feature Importance: Types & Pitfalls

Types:

- Split Gain (importance_): Sum of impurity reduction (RF) or gain (boosting) per feature.
- Frequency (split count).
- Permutation Importance: Measures generalization performance drop upon feature shuffling.
- SHAP Values: Consistent local/global importance based on Shapley values for tree ensembles (fast algorithms for XGBoost/LightGBM/TreeExplainer).

Pitfalls:

- Correlated features dilute importance across alternatives (RF + boosting both affected).
- High-cardinality categoricals can dominate gain via spurious partitions.
- Early splits bias impurity-based importance upward (mitigate via permutation or SHAP).
- SHAP for very deep or extremely large ensembles can still be expensive; sample wafers.

Recommended Workflow:

1. Start with permutation importance over validation set.
2. Use SHAP for top-k features to interpret directionality and interaction effects.
3. Validate engineering plausibility with process SMEs before acting.

## 8. Tuning Strategy Ladder (Pragmatic Sequence)

Baseline (Fast RF):

1. RandomForest: moderate n_estimators (300), max_depth=None, min_samples_leaf=2, max_features='sqrt'.
2. Collect permutation importance; prune obviously irrelevant signals.

Progress to HistGradientBoosting:

1. Set learning_rate=0.05–0.1, max_depth=6–10, max_leaf_nodes tuned 31→255, early_stopping=True with validation split.
1. Apply monotonic constraints where domain knowledge strong.

Escalate to XGBoost:

1. Start: eta=0.1, max_depth=6, subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8, min_child_weight=2, n_estimators=800 (early stopping around 50 rounds patience), reg_lambda=1.
1. Reduce eta to 0.05 → double trees if plateauing slowly; adjust min_child_weight upward if overfitting small wafer groups.
1. Tune gamma (0→2) if tree complexity excessive; explore colsample_bylevel.

Scale with LightGBM (large feature sets):

1. learning_rate=0.05, num_leaves=63 (ensure num_leaves ≤ 2^{max_depth}), feature_fraction=0.8, bagging_fraction=0.8, bagging_freq=1, min_data_in_leaf=20.
1. Increase num_leaves cautiously (log-scale) while monitoring validation AUC/RMSE gap; raise min_data_in_leaf if variance spikes.

Final Polishing:

1. Add limited randomized search (10–30 trials) focusing on: learning_rate, max_depth / num_leaves, subsample, colsample, min_child_weight / min_data_in_leaf, regularization (lambda, alpha), monotonic constraints toggles.
1. Calibrate probabilities (classification) via isotonic or Platt scaling using out-of-fold predictions for excursion risk ranking.
1. Export model card: hyperparameters, data snapshot hash, reproducibility seed, feature list, ethical/operational considerations.

## 9. Overfitting Indicators & Mitigation

Indicators:

- Training gain continues increasing while validation stagnates (boosting).
- SHAP interaction effects highlight spurious wafer ID leakage.
- Rapid performance degradation on new lot weeks (temporal drift sensitivity).

Controls:

- Early stopping (XGBoost: early_stopping_rounds, LightGBM: same parameter; supply validation set).
- Increase min_child_weight / min_data_in_leaf.
- Add L2 (lambda) regularization, or gamma / min_gain_to_split.
- Lower learning rate and proportionally increase estimators with patience.
- Apply temporal validation splits (respect lot start date ordering).

## 10. Semiconductor Use Case Mapping

| Use Case | Objective | Recommended Starting Ensemble | Notes |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------------|-------|
| Early Yield Prediction | Regression (RMSE) | HistGradientBoosting | Fast dev, monotonic constraints for known negative drifts |
| Parametric Excursion Classification | Classification (Recall@FPR) | XGBoost | Robust probability calibration & imbalance handling |
| Virtual Metrology | Regression (MAE) | LightGBM | Large sparse engineered feature sets |
| Predictive Maintenance | Time-to-fail / binary | RandomForest → XGBoost | Start RF for robustness; escalate for subtle nonlinearities |
| Process Window Optimization | Regression surface | LightGBM | Constraints + efficiency across dense grid evaluations |

## 11. Governance & Reproducibility

Key Artifacts to Persist:

- Random seed(s) for Python, NumPy, libraries.
- Full hyperparameter dictionary + search space.
- Feature schema (names, dtypes, transformation steps & versions).
- Data time window & filtering logic (lot weeks, product families included/excluded).
- Model binary + version hash (e.g., SHA256 of serialized buffer).
- Metrics with confidence intervals via bootstrapping.

Drift Monitoring Hooks:

- Population Stability Index across key engineered features.
- Rolling validation residual distribution shifts (KS test).
- Alert thresholds tied to business KPIs (yield delta > X basis points).

Compliance/Explainability:

- Store SHAP summary plot artifact for baseline model.
- Document monotonic constraints rationale (traceability to engineering priors).
- Provide fallback surrogate (simpler linear model) for rapid approximate reasoning when explainability escalations occur.

## 12. Practical Parameter Impact Table

| Parameter | Model(s) | Increase Effect | Decrease Effect | Risk if Mis-set |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| n_estimators | All boosting/RF | Lower bias (until plateau) | Underfit if too low | Training time blow-up |
| learning_rate (eta) | Boosting | Need more trees; better gen | Faster fit but overfit risk | Under/overfit confusion |
| max_depth / num_leaves | All tree models | Capture higher-order interactions | Simpler, higher bias | Explosive variance |
| subsample / bagging_fraction | Boosting | Regularization; speed | Less stochasticity | Instability if too low (<0.5) |
| colsample_* / feature_fraction | Boosting | De-correlation, reg | Full feature use | Miss key interactions |
| min_child_weight / min_data_in_leaf | Boosting/LightGBM | Prunes noise leaves | Fine-grained splits | Underfit rare but real patterns |
| lambda / alpha | XGBoost | Smoother weights | Sharper fits | Excessive shrinkage |
| gamma / min_gain_to_split | XGBoost/LightGBM | Prunes weak splits | More complexity | Miss subtle signals |
| monotonic constraints | HistGB/XGB/LGBM | Enforce domain priors | Allow flexibility | False constraints degrade accuracy |

## 13. Minimal Reproducible Template (Conceptual)

Data Split Strategy (Temporal):

1. Train: historical weeks W0–Wk-8
2. Validation: weeks Wk-7–Wk-3 (early stopping, tuning)
3. Test (locked): weeks Wk-2–Wk (final report)

Cross-validation (if temporal leakage controlled): GroupKFold by lot or product to prevent over-optimistic scores.

## 14. When to Prefer Simpler Models

Use penalized linear / generalized additive models when:

- Need fast interpretability turnaround for root-cause escalation boards.
- Feature engineering encodes nonlinearities explicitly (ratios, interactions) already.
- Data regime is small (few hundred wafers) where ensemble variance dominates.

## 15. Migration Path to Stacking

Stacking adds a meta-learner (e.g., penalized logistic/linear regression) over out-of-fold predictions from diverse base models (RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, calibrated linear). Benefits when:

- Individual models make complementary errors (analyze correlation matrix of residuals/probabilities).
- Risk of single-model brittleness under process shifts.

Operational Safeguards:

- Use nested CV or hold-out for meta-learner training (avoid leakage).
- Calibrate each base model before stacking for stable meta coefficients.

## 16. Common Failure Modes & Diagnostics

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnostic | Action |
|---------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Validation AUC stagnates early | Learning rate too high | Plot eval metric vs. trees | Lower eta, raise trees |
| Train >> Validation score gap | Overfitting depth/leaves | Depth distribution of splits | Increase min_child_weight, add regularization |
| Feature importance dominated by ID columns | Leakage | Permutation on suspect features | Remove / hash-bucket / aggregate |
| Performance drift over time | Process shift | Rolling window metrics | Retrain with windowing, drift features |
| SHAP shows implausible sign | Correlation or data artifact | Partial dependence vs. domain expectation | Constrain monotonicity, re-engineer features |
